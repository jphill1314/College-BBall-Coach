(Note to the reader: I will be using ‘user’ to refer to the real person who is playing this game and ‘player’ to fictional in-game characters that comprise the basketball teams. Also, some knowledge of college basketball is assumed for discussions of the various elements of simulating a college basketball team.)

## Main Feature: Basketball Simulator

The main feature of this game is the simulation of basketball games. Each team is made of players who have numeric ratings for all of the skills that are involved in playing basketball (dribbling, shooting, passing, defending, etc.). Based on these ratings (and some RNG) probabilities are determined for which action a player will take on a given play. Once the type of play is determined (pass the ball, take a shot, etc.), the player’s probability of success is determined based again on the player’s ratings and the player’s defender’s ratings. During the game, every player’s ratings are modified in two ways by the user’s interactions with his or her team. The first way is in managing player fatigue. Each player gains fatigue during every play that they are on the court for and they lose fatigue during timeouts, halftime, and while on the bench. More fatigue results in poorer success on the court, so the user must carefully manage their players to get the most performance from their team. Each player’s rating is also modified by the user’s team talks. Before the game, at halftime, and during each timeout, the user is able to address their team to encourage their players, challenge them, or to tell them to focus on offense or defense. Which talk the user selects is combined with other factors, such as home court advantage and the relative scores of the teams, to determine whether the team will perform better or worse. Finally the user is also able to control (to some extent) which plays their players run. By modifying their team’s strategy, the user is able to encourage their players to play faster or slower, or to shoot more or fewer threes, as well as how aggressive the players should be on defense. 

Overall, the game simulation produces realistic scores and stat lines and properly favors the better team and home court advantage. There are some areas that I would like to improve upon in the future though. Currently, a player that is about to shoot free throws is able to be substituted regardless of the result of the player’s final free throw (a sub should only occur if the player makes their final free throw). The AI that governs the non-player controlled teams also leaves a bit to be desired. Oftentimes, the AI will often play its players out of position which results in sub-optimal lineups. The AI is also incapable of making complex substitutions. For example, Player A moves to Player B’s position and Player B is substituted for Player C, who plays in Player A’s former position. Allowing the AI to make such substitutions would likely result in fewer occurrences of sub-optimal lines described above. The AI also currently does not change it strategy during games. The strategy options are also fairly limiting in the closing moments of a ‘close and late situation.’ In real life basketball, it oftentimes makes sense to shoot threes as quickly as possible or try to run out the clock, but these strategies are currently impossible to use in the current state of the game. The simulation would also benefit from the inclusion of the ability to use full-court defenses or zone defenses.

## Other Features

The other features of the game are fairly simple in comparison to the game simulation. The roster screen allows the user to set their starting line and to view their players’ ratings and statistics. The biggest room for improvement here is in the viewing of statistics. I would like to add the ability to view statistics from previous seasons and season averages for players. Another possible addition here is to add the ability to give each player a role on the team which would affect what the player does in game. For example, giving a player a role of ‘floor general’ will make them focus on passing the ball to their open teammates for great shots or a role of ‘sharp shooter’ will have the player focus on taking and making three pointers.

The schedule screen allows the user to view all of their team’s games for the current season and the results of the games played. One obvious area for improvement is to add an easy indicator of whether a game was won or lost by the team being viewed. This screen could also benefit from adding the ability to preview upcoming games to easily compare how the two teams that will be playing.

The standings screen allows the user to view each conference’s standings as well as the overall RPI ranking for all teams. This screen could be improved by implementing the modern formula for RPI (home wins count less than road wins) and by implementing other rating metrics such as strength of schedule or strength of victory or even pythagorean win percentage.

The recruiting screen allows the user to view all possible recruits for their team. Currently, getting a recruit to commit to your team is based on the recruit’s interest in your team and the assigned coach’s recruiting ability. I would like to modify this to be less of a ‘set and forget’ experience and instead reward a more active handling of recruiting. This could possibly be achieved by requiring the player to make promises to get a commitment from a recruit. This could be playing time or role or how many wins the team will get in the next season. Another thing to add could be scouting of recruits which would reveal some of their ratings. This would allow the user to look for a player with certain abilities that they desire on their team.

(The strategy screen and its potential changes were discussed at the end of the game simulation discussion.)

The staff screen allows a player to view their staff and their staff’s ratings. This is the most useless screen in the game currently as you cannot interact with your staff in any way. To change this, it would be beneficial to hire and fire staff as well as to train your current staff to become better at certain skills.

The player training screen allows the user to direct the training of each of their players. The more general roles (big and guard) train more skills than the specific roles (energy guy, three point specialist, etc.), but do not improve the skills as quickly as the specific roles.This screen could be improved by being more transparent about what skills each role works on. It could also be useful to be able to see how a player’s ratings have changed over time.

## Technology

On the technology side, this project was fairly straight forward. Room was used to handle the app’s SQLite database and AsyncTasks were used to save and load the data, as well as run the game simulations. Firebase was used to handle crash reporting and analytics.

## Future

While I mentioned how I would like to improve the existing features of the game, there are some other ideas that I think would be good additions to the game. I would like to support women’s basketball as well. The only significant changes that this would require is changing the game simulator to also support quarters and have media timeouts and bonus free throws reflect this. A larger addition that I would like to add is giving each school a ‘personality.’ This would mean that different schools would have different levels of investment in their team. With higher financial investment, the user would be able to field a larger team, recruit more players at one time, and schedule more non-conference home games. Higher fan investment would give the user a greater home court advantage, but also place higher expectations on the team for on-court success. This could lead to a system in which the player (and other AI coaches) could be hired and fired by different schools. Another possible improvement would be to add an in-game tutorial.
