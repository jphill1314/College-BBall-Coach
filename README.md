# College Basketball Coach

Attempt at an Android game that simulates the experience of being the head coach of a college basketball team.

Players will get to manage their team's roster, recruiting, strategy, staff, and training (and maybe scheduling non-conference games too?).
I would also like to add a detailed simulation of every play in a basketball game to allow for greater control of performace on the court.
